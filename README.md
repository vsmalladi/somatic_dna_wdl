```

### Write input and submit
<a name="write_input"></a>


Script `somatic_dna_wdl/run.sh` will first quickly validate the WDL workflow. Next it will use the WDL 
to determine which variables are required. All required variables will be defined from the 
Reference JSON in config, the pairing/sample info or the custom inputs JSON.

Most URIs for files will be validated to ensure you can read the file (unless the `--skip-validate` flag is used). If a pipeline has the variable `production` and/or `external` and these are set to true then the pipeline will skip tasks that require private NYGC files or licenses. Because of this if either `production` or `external` are true for a workflow private NYGC files will not have their uris validated.

Next, the input JSON will be compared to the original WDL and the program will exit if any required variable could not be found and will need to be provided in the custom input JSON.

Then the workflow will be submitted to the cromwell server.

In addition to submitting the command, this will create an output file that you should save. It contains information about the project, pipeline version, cromwell options, inputs. It will also contain the workflow UUID. This will be used after the run to agregate information about the run.
```
somatic_dna_wdl/run.sh -h
run.sh [-h] --options OPTIONS --wdl-file WDL_FILE
               --url URL --log-dir LOG_DIR
               --project-name PROJECT_NAME
               [--library {WGS,Exome}]
               [--genome {Human_GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla, Human_GRCh38_tcga}]
               [--pairs-file PAIRS_FILE]
               [--samples-file SAMPLES_FILE]
               [--interval-list {SureSelect_V6plusCOSMIC.target.GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla}]
               [--custom-inputs [CUSTOM_INPUTS [CUSTOM_INPUTS ...]]]
               [--skip-validate]
               [--dry-run]

DESCRIPTION: validate workflow, create input json and submit workflow to cromwell.
    Script requires jq, cromwell-tools, gcloud to be in the path.
    Script shows submission command and command to check status
    in the STDERR stream.
  Creation of input JSON:
    The WDL is used to determine which variables are required.
    Required or optional variables are defined from custom inputs JSON.
    Any required variable not defined in the custom inputs JSON will be defined from the
    reference JSONs in the config directory (as long as the variable names are identical).
    The pairing/sample info CSVs (--pairs-file/--samples-file) are used to create pairRelationships and
    (if columns named tumorBam and normalBam exist) map BAMs to pairs.
    If "production" or "external" inputs are true then validation of NYGC internal-only files is skipped
    The pipelines are written to skip tasks that localize these files if "production" or "external" are true
    so any inability to read these files will not negatively affect the run.
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --url URL             Cromwell server URL (required)
  --log-dir LOG_DIR     Output directory for all logs and reports
                        related to this workflow UUID (required)
  --options OPTIONS     Options json file for cromwell (required)
  --wdl-file WDL_FILE   WDL workflow. An input JSON that matches this
                        WDL workflow will be created (required)
  --file-out FILE_OUT   Output file for project info
  --custom-inputs-out CUSTOM_INPUTS_OUT
                        Output file for custom workflow inputs
  --custom-labels-out CUSTOM_LABELS_OUT
                        Output file for workflow labels
  --library {WGS,Exome}
                        Sequence library type.
  --genome {Human_GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla, Human_GRCh38_tcga}
                        Genome key to use for pipeline.
  --project-name PROJECT Project name associated with account.
  --pairs-file PAIRS_FILE
                        CSV file with items that are required to have
                        "tumor", "normal" and "pairId" in the columns.
                        Optionally, include "tumorBam", "normalBam" columns to create
                        "pairInfos" and "normalSampleBamInfos" automatically.
  --samples-file [SAMPLES_FILE]
                        Not generally required. If tasks only require
                        sampleId and do not use pairing information sample
                        info can be populated with a CSV file. The CSV file
                        requires a columns named ["sampleId"].
  --interval-list {SureSelect_V6plusCOSMIC.target.GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla}
                        File basename for interval list.If not supplied the
                        default (the SureSelect interval list for your genome)
                        will be used (only needed for future Exome workflows)
  --custom-inputs [CUSTOM_INPUTS]
                        Optional JSON file with custom input variables. The
                        name of the variable in the input file must match the
                        name of the variable in the WDL workflow. It is not
                        required that the input specify the workflow. By
                        default the input will be added to the top-level
                        workflow. Any variable defined in in this JSON will
                        overwrite any reference variable in the the config
                        directory or workflow default.
  --skip-validate       Skip the step where input files are validated.
                        Otherwise all gs//: URIs will be checked to see that a
                        file exists. Disable with caution. Cromwell will launch
                        instances and run without checking. Test a small pairs
                        file to ensure all references exist and at least some
                        sample input files can be read by the current user.
  --dry-run             Skip the step where the job is submitted to cromwell-tools.
```

Command

```
# Create input json
cd ${working-dir}

../somatic_dna_wdl/run.sh \
--log-dir ${working-dir} \
--url ${url} \
--project-name ${lab_quote_number} \
--pairs-file ${tumor_normal_pairs_csv} \
--library WGS \
--genome Human_GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla \
--wdl-file somatic_dna_wdl/somatic_wkf.wdl \
--options options.json \
--custom-inputs-out ${lab_quote_number}.inputs.json \
--custom-labels-out ${lab_quote_number}.labels.json \
--file-out ${lab_quote_number}.projectInfo.json
```


#### Output:

  1. `somatic_wkfInput.json` - inputs for cromwell
  2. `${lab_quote_number}_projectInfo.json` - contains project info like the current list of samples/pairs and the library type as well as the pipeline version (tag and commit). 
  3. `${lab_quote_number}_project.<DATE>.RunInfo.json` - contains projectInfo, workflow Input, workflow UUID.


### Post run
<a name="post_run"></a>

Use the `cromwell-tools status` command printed to the screen when you submitted the workflow. Alternately, lookup the workflow UUID in the `lab-number_project.<DATE>.RunInfo.json` and run:

```
cromwell-tools status \
--url ${url} \
--username $(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="cromwell_username") \
--password $(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="cromwell_password") \
--uuid ${uuid}
```

After workflow finishes and the status is `SUCCEEDED` or while it is running use `run_summary.sh` to review run metrics and cost:

```
USAGE: run_summary.sh -u URL -n PROJECT_NAME -g GCP_PROJECT -d log_dir [-r RUNINFO_JSON] [-i UUID] [-b BILLING EXPORT] [--from-billing] [-p PAIRS_FILE] [-s SAMPLES_FILE]
DESCRIPTION: monitor or summarize cromwell workflow.
Script requires jq to be in the path.
If no *.RunInfo.json file OR uuid is provided then
the most recent file in the log dir will be used
Script generates summary of any workflow.
-h, --help          Show this help message and exit
  --billing-export BILLING     The name of the table for the SQL query
                               of the billing table.
  --from-billing               Skip regenerating runtime metrics. Use existing
                               metrics files; add the cost values from the billing
                               table; and plot the results (including billing).
  --gcp-project GCP_PROJECT    GCP project id for api queries.
  --run-info-json RUNINFO_JSON Optional file that includes any sampleIds and the
                               main workflow UUID.
  --url URL                    Cromwell server URL (required)
  --log-dir LOG_DIR            Output directory for all logs and reports
                               related to this workflow UUID (required)
  --project-name PROJECT_NAME  Project name associated with account.
  --pairs-file PAIRS_FILE
                               Optional, CSV file with items that are required to have
                               "tumor", "normal" and "pairId" in the columns.
                               Optionally, include "tumorBam", "normalBam" columns to create
                               "pairInfos" and "normalSampleBamInfos" automatically.
  --samples-file [SAMPLES_FILE]
                               Not generally required. If tasks only require
                               sampleId and do not use pairing information sample
                               info can be populated with a CSV file. The CSV file
                               requires a columns named ["sampleId"].
```

Command:

```
bash templates/run_summary.sh \
-u ${url} \
-d ${log_dir} \
-p ${gcp_project} \
-n ${project_name}
```

Optionally add `-r ${run_info}` or `--uuid ${uuid}` to the command. Otherwise, the script will use the
most recent `*RunInfo.json` file in the `${log_dir}`.

If you do not have a `*RunInfo.json` you can start with the workflow uuid 
(a sample or pair csv file can also be indicated but is not required).

```
bash \
templates/run_summary.sh \
-u ${url} \
-d ${log_dir} \
-b ${billing_export} \
-n ${project_name} \
-g ${gcp_project} \
--uuid ${uuid} \
--samples-file ${sample_id_list}
```

#### NOTE: Optionally add the following flag (where `${billing_export}` 
is the name of the table for the SQL query) to add cost per instance_id to results:

```
-b ${billing_export}
```


#### Output:
If the workflow finishes and the status is `SUCCEEDED` and you have run `run_summary.sh`. It will output several log files:

`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>_outputInfo.json` :

Conatins relevant information on the run including:
  - `named_files`: list of output files (in the final location)
  - `outputs`: map between workflow output object-name and object (in the final bucket/location)
  - `options`: options values from run
  - `workflow_uuid`: uuid
  - `run_date`: run_date
  - `status`: status
  - `pair_association` : map of pair_ids to the `outputs` map for just that pair (searches for the pair_id followed by . _ or / )
  - `sample_association` : map of sample_ids to the `outputs` map for just that sample (searches for the sample_id followed by . _ or / )

Note: Pair association only works if the pair_id is used in the filename followed by a `.`, `/` or a `_`. Sample association only works if the sample_id is used in the filename followed by a `.` or a `_`. 


`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>_outputMetrics.csv`
the file includes the following metrics calculated from the BigQuery cromwell monitor:

       'task_call_name', 'wdl_task_name', 'sub_workflow_name', 'workflow_name',
       'execution_status', 'cpu_count', 'disk_types', 'docker_image',
       'attempt', 'backend_status', 'preemptible', 'instance_name', 'zone',
       'project_id', 'return_code', 'workflow_id', 'shard', 'start_time',
       'end_time', 'localization_m', 'inputs', 'main_workflow_name', 'labels',
       'id', 'instance_id', 'cpu_platform', 'mem_total_gb', 'disk_mounts',
       'disk_total_gb', 'actual_start_time', 'wait_time_m', 'actual_runtime_m',
       'max_cpu_used_percent', 'max_disk_used_gb', 'max_mem_used_gb',
       'run_time', 'run_time_m', 'cpu_time_m', 'sample_task_run_time_h',
       'sample_task_core_h', 'sample_subworkflow_core_h',
       'sample_subworkflow_run_time_h', 'subworkflow_max_mem_g',
       'sample_workflow_core_h', 'sample_workflow_run_time_h',
       'workflow_max_mem_g', 'main_workflow_id', 'cromwell_workflow_id',
       'avg_capacity_cost', 'avg_core_cost', 'avg_egress_cost', 'avg_ram_cost',
       'avg_total_cost', 'runtime_scaled_total_cost', 'machine_type',
       'disk_type'
    
`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>_outputMetrics.html`
This file includes plots of runtime metrics.
  
`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>_outputCosts.csv`
This is the table returned from the billing db on the cloud (only created if the billing table flag is used)

`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>.outputMetrics.cost.csv`
This is the metrics table with the costs added (only created if the billing table flag is used)

`${lab_quote_number}<WORKFLOW_UUID>.outputMetrics.total.csv`
This is the end-to-end cost for the pipeline (according to the billing table) (only created if the billing table flag is used)

### Create new workflow
<a name="create_new_workflow"></a>

Use a [style guide](https://biowdl.github.io/styleGuidelines.html) to write you WDL files.

1. Write a new workflow (e.g. `wdl_port/new_wkf.wdl`) using structs from `wdl_structs.wdl` were needed. Use the variable from `config/fasta_references.json` and `config/interval_references.json` in your workflow (e.g. `referenceFa`)
  - keep your tasks and sub workflow in a separate WDL file in a subdirectory. That workflow should run a section of the pipeline on one sample/pair. 
  - In the main directory make a WDL that runs the sub workflow(s) for a list of `sampleInfo` or `pairInfo` objects.
  - Alternately add your subworkflow to an existing main workflow (e.g. `calling_wkf.wdl`)
2. Add any new required resource files to `config/fasta_references.json` and `config/interval_references.json`.
3. Upload any new resource files:

```
# modified or in-house files
gsutil cp \
${file} \
gs://${resources_project}/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla/internal/
# external reference files
gsutil cp \
${file} \
gs://${resources_project}/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla/external/
```
4. Confirm all workflows are still valid and commit changes

Also confirm that all workflows continue to be valid before commiting your changes

```
for file in */*wdl *wdl; do 
  echo $file; 
  womtool validate $file; 
done
# commit your changes and create new inputs file (with new branch and commit info)
git commit -m "feat: my new workflow"
```

5. [Run](#write_input) the new workflow as before
